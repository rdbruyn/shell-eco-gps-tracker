This python script was written for Team Apex, who participated in the Shell Eco
Marathon in 2018 as part of the University of Johannesburg's Systems and Design
module.

# Description

This script was used on a Raspberry Pi unit in our vehicle, in order to track
the distance travelled by the vehicle, as well as the time which the driver
still has to complete their laps. Since the objective of the event is to take
as long as possible to drive around the track in order to be as efficient as
possible, this unit used three LED arrays in order to indicate to the driver to
speed up, maintain speed, or slow down, in order to complete the course within
the given time limit.

# Hardware

The hardware used for this tracking system was

* Raspberry Pi Model 3B
* Adafruit Ultimate GPS breakout board
* Assorted BJT transistors along with biasing resistors that act as switches
  for the LED arrays.
